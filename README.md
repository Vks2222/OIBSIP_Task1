# OIBSIP_Task1

I created a calculator website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure defines the calculator display and buttons. CSS styles provide a visually appealing design for responsiveness. JavaScript handles user input, performs calculations, and updates the display. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, and buttons are responsive to both mouse clicks and keyboard input.

The project serves as a practical exercise to enhance web development skills, offering a foundation for further improvements and features.
